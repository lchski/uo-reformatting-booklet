# uOttawa Reformatting Bookmarklet

Dividing numbers by 3 is annoying. With this bookmarklet, credit numbers are reduced to "courses".

GitHub (sensibly) doesn't allow embedding JS. Copy the code into [a bookmarklet generator](http://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/) and get the bookmarklet from there.

## Compatibility

Tested against this list:

* 48 credits
* 12 optional course credits
* 3 optional seminar course credits
* 18 elective course credits

## Caveats

Some things to keep in mind:

* Doesn't play great with courses that are any credit value *other* than 3.
* Doesn't bother dividing credit counts unaccompanied by the "credit" keyword.
